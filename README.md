DESCRIPTION:


In this task, I implemented a simulated **Multi-Cloud Architecture** using only **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to showcase the concept of distributing services as if they were hosted across multiple cloud providers. The objective was to demonstrate how different services within a cloud ecosystem can communicate and operate independently, similar to a multi-cloud setup.

I used multiple AWS regions and availability zones to simulate service distribution. For example, a **frontend web server** was deployed in one region (e.g., US East - N. Virginia), while a **backend application or database service** was set up in another region (e.g., US West - Oregon). These services interacted over the internet using public IPs and secure communication protocols.

The project focused on **interoperability, scalability, and fault tolerance** â€” key principles of multi-cloud architecture. I also configured **security groups, IAM roles, and routing policies** to enable controlled communication between services.

Though executed within AWS, this setup reflects the same design principles used in true multi-cloud environments and provided valuable experience in managing distributed cloud systems.
